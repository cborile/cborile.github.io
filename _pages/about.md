Hi! I'm Claudio Borile, researcher in AI and Complex Systems at the [CENTAI Institute](http://centai.eu) in Turin, Italy.

With a foundation in Physics and a doctoral focus on computational and analytical models in ecology and biology, my career has been dedicated to applying complex systems science and machine learning to diverse scientific and technological challenges. 
Initially, I utilized statistical physics to analyze the emergent behaviors of multi-agent stochastic dynamical systems and artificial neural networks. 
My expertise then expanded to encompass a broader range of data science and machine learning methodologies for interdisciplinary applied research. A key experience includes my involvement in the precision medicine project DEFLeCT, developing cutting-edge machine learning techniques for multi-omic and multi-source analyses in non-small cell lung cancer patients, gaining familiarity with complex single-cell data. 
Currently, my work centers on developing AI algorithms and statistical methods to investigate complex collective behaviors, from financial networks to data-driven learning of agent-based models, with an emphasis on explainability and interpretability in generative AI models.
